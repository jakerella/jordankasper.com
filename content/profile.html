    <p>
        I'm a mild-mannered developer and technology advocate by day... and, well, by night too, 
        I suppose. Shortly after it arrived at my home in 1993 I began disassembling my first 
        computer - my mother was not happy. She breathed more easily when I moved from hardware 
        into programming. My experience includes software development, cybersecurity, instruction, 
        and developer advocacy at startups, digital agencies, Fortune 100 companies, higher education,
        and state and local governments. I also maintain a few 
        <a href='https://github.com/jakerella' target='_blank'>open source projects</a>. My 
        programming experience includes all things web (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), Node.js, PHP, 
        Java, bash, Python, Natural, and more. I speak regularly at (and help organize) local user 
        groups and conferences, big and small. My primary mission for over 20 years has been to 
        evangelize good software development practices and share what I've learned to help others '
        grow. In my down time I enjoy <a href='/games'>games and puzzles of all sorts</a>!
