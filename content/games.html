    <h3>Ni-ju-san</h3>

    <p>
        This is my first published board game! In Ni-ju-san, to reach enlightenment you must find, follow, and complete your 
        path, but you are not alone, there are others on this path. The path is not for the timid, if enlightenment were easy, 
        everyone would attain it. It is ever changing, and there are perils to keep even the wisest from succeeding. Choose 
        your actions carefully!

    <h3>Guessle</h3>

    <p>
        This is a Wordle Clone with a few extra features. It's essentially the same rules, but you can play more than once a day. 
        The game uses the Official Scrabble dictionary as both the selection of "solution" words, and to check guesses. Among other 
        features are the ability to play 5- or 6-letter words, use default opening words, and change the difficulty (depth of the 
        dictionary in terms of word frequencies).

    <h3>P52</h3>

    <p>
        This is a Role Playing Game (RPG) with as few necessary supplies/pieces as possible (fewer things to buy and carry with you). 
        The game is much more simple than most RPGs, requiring no Dungeon Master (DM), and only 2 decks of playing cards, 
        these instructions, pencil and paper, and a token for each character/player. While the instructions may seem long for 
        players new to RPG systems, they are significantly shorter than the instructions for most RPGs - some of which are printed 
        in numerous 100+ page volumes!

    <p>
        There are a few scenarios built into the game system, but you can always create more based on the mechanics.

    <h3>Prince Albert</h3>

    <p>
        Prince Albert is a simple card game that combines elements of poker, gin rummy, and point bidding to create a unique 
        card-game experience. The game is played with a standard playing card deck and works with 2-4 players (although you can 
        alter the rules slightly to play with five).
