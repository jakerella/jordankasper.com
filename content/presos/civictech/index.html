        * Whether you realize it or not, you benefit from government technology<br>
        * But Government tech struggles to keep up with industry, in large people because of a lack of talent<br>
        * Simple fact is: tech is created by the people who show up<br>
        * We need smart people like all of you get involved<br>
        * Share my journey with a recent example, and talk about how you can be a #civictech hero

		1. Problem doesn't have to be big and flashy, just find a user and ask about pain points<br>
        2. We'll talk about open data and APIs, and where you can find them<br>
        3. Build one, small thing. Put it out there, get someone using it, collect feedback, repeat!

    <aside class='notes'>
        * I knew someone who was complaining about this site and its poor functionality<br>
        * I listened, asked questions, and asked what would make things better<br>
        * (go back one slide) One issue was that many lawyers copy & paste a "docket ID" from the Federal Register into regulations.goc<br>
        * this copied ID has a special character in it that regulations.gov doesn't recognize, meaning the search fails<br>
        * This is an easy fix: we know what special character it is, so we just remove it before performing a search<br>
        * Then, I needed to do some investigation...

        * API limit wouldn't be as much of an issue except that the data architecture is poor<br>
        * Specifically, each comment requires an individual API request, and many proposed regulations can have tens of thousands of comments<br>

        Step 1. ask user to register on api.data.gov and trust us with their key<br>
        * User's enter docket ID, or specific "document" ID<br>
        * We cache data from API, so all users benefit<br>
        * If data is not cached, use user's API key to hit API<br>
        * Have to make multiple calls for most requests (get all comments), which we do in batches due to second rate limit (req/s)<br>
