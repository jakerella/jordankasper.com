I've noticed lately that I have had very little time to focus on the projects that I'm really interested in... the ones that inspire me, and that encouraged me to jump ship in the first place. This is bad for lots of reasons, not the least of which is that I'm feeling the burn - the burn that comes before the burn out. I've been working on contracts for other people, and while some of them are okay, most of them just tend to be tedious. Its not my clients' fault, the projects are all very important to them, but its just not what I want to be doing, nor what I set out to do originally.

As I mentioned, I've been noticing this lately - which is, in itself, a good thing. That is, the fact that I recognize this will hopefully let me address the issue before I get sick of what I'm doing. In fact, I've talked to [my wife](http://samaraspence.com) about it, and here's what we've decided: I need to focus. Duh. But more than that, if I don't take the time to focus on the projects that I am interested in, they have no chance of succeeding. So, with that in mind, after our big move (she's going to law school), I will cease to pick up new contracts and instead devote my time to [these](http://thesimpleexplanation.com) [other ](http://nationate.com)[projects](http://trackthepig.com).

Obviously this means I won't be making contract money, and that could turn into an issue, but I have to try something, and this is it. Wish me luck.
